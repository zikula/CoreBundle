# <?php echo $namespace . "\n"; ?>

This extension was generated by CoreBundle.

The `config/generated_dev.yaml` file has been updated to set `maker:root_namespace` value to <?php echo $bundleClass ?>.

In order to use other `make:foo` commands, you must install the extension!
 - first run `php bin/console cache:clear`
 - second run `php bin/console z:e:i <?php echo $bundleClass ?>`
